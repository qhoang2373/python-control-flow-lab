# Exercise 1: Vowel or Consonant
#
# Write a Python function named `check_letter` that determines if a given letter
# is a vowel or a consonant.
#
# Requirements:
# - The function should prompt the user to enter a letter (a-z or A-Z) and determine its type.
# - It should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.
# - If the letter is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u), print: "The letter x is a vowel."
# - If the letter is a consonant, print: "The letter x is a consonant."
# - Replace 'x' with the actual letter entered by the user.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture user input.
# - Utilize the `in` operator to check for vowels.
# - Ensure to provide feedback for non-alphabetical or invalid entries.

def check_letter():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    letter = input("Enter a letter (a-z or A-Z): ")

    if len(letter) == 1 and letter.isalpha():
        letter = letter.lower()
    
    if letter in "aeiou":
        print(f"The letter '{letter}' is a vowel.")
    elif letter.isalpha():
        print(f"The letter '{letter}' is a consonant." )
    else:
        print("Invalid input")

# Call the function
check_letter()

# Exercise 2: Old enough to vote?
#
# Write a Python function named `check_voting_eligibility` that determines if a user is old enough to vote.
# Fill in the logic to perform the eligibility check inside the function.
#
# Function Details:
# - Prompt the user to input their age: "Please enter your age: "
# - Validate the input to ensure the age is a possible value (no negative numbers).
# - Determine if the user is eligible to vote. Set a variable for the voting age.
# - Print a message indicating whether the user is eligible to vote based on the entered age.
#
# Hints:
# - Use the `input()` function to capture the user's age.
# - Use `int()` to convert the input to an integer. Ensure to handle any conversion errors gracefully.
# - Use a conditional statement to check if the age meets the minimum voting age requirement.

def check_voting_eligibility():
    # Your control flow logic goes here
    voting_age = 18

    try:
        age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))

        if age < 0:
            print("Invalid age. Age cannot be negative.")
        elif age >= voting_age:
            print("You are eligible to vote!")
        else:
            print("You are not old enough to vote.")

    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")

# Call the function
check_voting_eligibility()
